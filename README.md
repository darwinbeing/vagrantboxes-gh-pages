This repository contains a spike for a new version of the [Vagrantbox.es](http://www.vagrantbox.es)
website, a list of third party base boxes for the lovely Vagrant virtualisation
tool.

The intent behind placing the code here is to discuss an alternative way of building
the website using Jekyll and GitHub pages with the intent of making contributions
easier and less error prone. A side effect of it will be that we won't have a need
for Heroku and Travis-CI for auto deploys as GitHub will take care of it for us :-)

The idea is to have this merged / ported back into to the original [GitHub](https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku)
repository, so please keep an eye on [this issue](https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku/issues/271)
for updates.
